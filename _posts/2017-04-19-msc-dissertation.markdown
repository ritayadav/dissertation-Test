Summary:	The comparative analysis based on quantitative analysis of algorithms is performed based on the hit/miss rates and the number write counts. Using the trace-driven simulation, when workload has high reference locality, LIRS-WSR has significantly superior performance than CCF-LRU in terms of both hit rate and write count. LIRS-WSR has higher hit rate up to 17.5% and minimizes write count up to 37.17% in com- parison to CCF-LRU. For uniformly distributed workloads, the difference in hit rates, and write count of LIRS-WSR and CCF-LRU is comparatively small. LIRS-WSR outperforms CCF-LRU by increasing hit rate up to 3.8% and decreasing write count up to 9.23% in comparison to CCF-LRU in its worst case.<br>
